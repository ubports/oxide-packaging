        execution continues immediately.
      + Confirm and prompt dialogs from background webviews are suppressed.
      + Dialogs are automatically dismissed if another webview is brought to
        the foreground.
      + Before Unload dialogs will only be displayed if they are associated
        with a navigation that is application initiated or triggered from a
        user gesture. Otherwise, the navigation will proceed without a prompt.

      provided value (via WebContext::acceptLangs)

      intelligent. It now blocks auto hide in the following circumstances:
      - There is a security error

      - A certificate error request is active
    - Make use of WebContentsIDTracker in a couple of places to simplify

    - Fix a DCHECK when tearing down the webview compositor
    - Ensure StoragePartitions are correctly shutdown to avoid a DCHECK

      implementation on Unity8
    - Fix LP: #1649577 - popup menu regression
    - Fix LP: #1649861 - session save/restore across oxide versions

    - Make checkouts a bit faster by disabling unnecessary gclient hooks
    - Use QWheelEvent::pixelDelta where possible
    - Refactor clipboard support and add a ClipboardObserver class

      associated with the currently displayed view
    - Ensure we correctly restore RenderWidget state when switching between
      interstitial / fullscreen views

    - Decouple SecurityStatus from WebView, and add extensive unit tests for
      this code

oxide-qt (1.15.7-0ubuntu0.15.04.1~overlay1) vivid; urgency=medium

  * Update to v1.15.7 (see USN-2992-1)
    - Bump Chromium rev to 51.0.2704.79
    - Fix LP: #1567542 - Ensure the camera image is rotated correctly for both
      front and back cameras, and fix a krillin-specific issue
    - Fix LP: #1570511 / LP: #1586968 - Allow touch selection to short circuit
      context menu requests
    - Fix LP: #1569315 - Make WebView::EditingCapabilitiesChanged faster to
      avoid serious performance issues with an active selection
    - Disable plugins by default on arm, as we only support Flash which isn't
      available there
    - Compile native arm and x86 builds with -g1 to reduce the size of the
      resulting unstripped binary and hopefully ease address space pressure
      during linking. This will reduce the usefulness of crash reports on
      these platforms
    - Unbreak the !ENABLE_PLUGINS build
    - Fix LP: #1582060 - Ensure we attach the InputMethodContext for script
      opened webviews
    - Fix LP: #1578808 - link failure on armhf
    - Fix LP: #1576164 - Internationalize the camera names
    - Fix LP: #1556658 - Provide dummy message text to an application's custom
      beforeunload dialog component for compatibility purposes, now that
      Chromium ignores the one provided by the page
    - Fix LP: #1535818 - Add support for the deviceId constraint in getUserMedia
    - Fix LP: #1568860 - Replace use of scoped_ptr with std::unique_ptr

    - Fix LP: #1447395 - Add WebView.zoomFactor API
    - Fix LP: #1565063 - Add 'version' and 'chromiumVersion' properties to
      the API
    - Remove CompositorProxy and its implementation. This was left over from
      when the webview compositor wasn't single threaded
    - Remove RendererFrameEvictor - it's redundant anyway because we destroy
      the webview compositor when it's hidden. Now we just drive eviction from
      there instead. This removes a bogus dependency on GetFormFactorHint
    - Hide surface_id from compositor clients, cleaning up the client interface
    - Fix LP: #1498200 - Componentize qt/core/ and shared/. This allows us to
      build unit test binaries that depend on shared/
    - Drop the warning when changing the process model - single process is
      now supported.
    - Adapt the QML tests to run in single-process and make lots of test fixes
      (LP: #1399208)
    - Fix LP: #1399207 - Make it possible to skip entire QML test cases where
      they aren't relevant for specific configurations (eg, single process)

    - Disable profiler timing - we don't have chrome://profiler/, and this is
      disabled by default on Chrome/Android too due to it having a
      non-negligible performance impact.
    - Fix a shutdown abort in single-process mode
    - Add CookieStoreUIProxy, which is an implementation of net::CookieStore
      that proxies calls from the UI thread to the real cookie store on the IO
      thread. This is used in a couple of places where we need access to the
      cookie store on the UI thread
    - Fix LP: #1556762 - Add TouchSelectionController.handleDragInProgress
      property
    - Fix LP: #1556764 - Add TouchSelectionController.hide() API
    - Fix LP: #1552161 - Convert QTouchEvent directly to ui::MotionEvent.
      Dropping the use of ui::TouchEvent means we no longer have to round
      the scroll coordinates, which should improve smoothness on high-DPI
      screens

      before clicking on it. Add WebView.hoveredUrl property
    - Fix LP: #1504853 - Certificate errors in the browser are confusing -
      have the WebView navigate to a placeholder transient page when the
      browser displays the certificate error UI. This fixes several issues
      where the addressbar and back button didn't behave consistently in some
      cases
    - Fix LP: #1509384 - (PPAPI Flash) Flash plugin isn't always detected
      by BBC iPlayer. Ensure we load the plugin metadata so that

    - Fix LP: #1509433 - (PPAPI Flash) Enable the Flash plugin by default

      content is fullscreen because LocationBarController doesn't work. Always

      updated synchronously when transitioning to fullscreen, so add a hack for
      this (Chrome already does this too)

      Flash
    - Fix LP: #1510973 - (PPAPI Flash) Ensure we cancel a fullscreen request
      from Flash is the application doesn't grant fullscreen by setting
      WebView.fullscreen to true
    - Fix LP: #1517955 - Enable NEON unconditionally. Support for non-NEON
      builds in Chromium has been broken for ages, and the default (optional
      NEON with runtime detection) only works on Android without additional
      patches to make the detection work on non-Android builds. Given that
      upstream are planning enable NEON unconditionally and drop support for
      other configurations in the future, let's just do this now as it enables
      us to stop patching webrtc
    - Fix LP: #1518358 - Text selection is not greyed out when the window
      loses focus
    - Fix LP: #1341565 - Should include plugin typeinfo (plugins.qmltypes)
    - Fix LP: #1408109 - Remove StoragePermissionRequest. This was never
      completed, has never been tested, isn't used anywhere and is going to
      get in the way of site settings
    - Fix LP: #1510503 - WebView.fullscreenRequested shouldn't fire if
      fullscreen is already granted
    - Fix LP: #1510506 - (PPAPI Flash) NOTIMPLEMENTED() hit in WebContentsView

      content::GpuChannelHost::Send, by deliberately leaking the
      cc::ContextProvider referenced by any task posted to the UI thread if
      the task never got a chance to run and is destroyed when the main loop
      is torn down. Note that 1.6 has the longer term fix for this crash.
    - Fix LP: #1421339 - Two scrollbars shown on the phone at a page scale of 1.
      + This is fixed by disabling the outer viewport scrollbars when

oxide-qt (1.5.3-0ubuntu2) vivid; urgency=medium

  * Update to v1.5.3
    - Bump Chromium rev to 41.0.2272.53
    - Fix LP: #1402975 - set a minimum viewport width of 980px on mobile
      for sites that don't specify a viewport width. Fixes layout of some
      desktop sites, and matches the behaviour of Chrome on Android
    - Fix LP: #1412981 - Geolocation permission requests from subframes are
      not cancelled if the frame is deleted or navigated to another site
    - Fix LP: #1379776 - Spoof Android for the purposes of GPU feature
      blacklisting on the phone. This means accelerated 2d canvas is now
      enabled on all devices that Chrome enables it on (including the Nexus 4),
      and other GPU features (eg, GPU rasterization) are enabled on devices
      where Chrome supports it
    - Fix LP: #1370366 - Add LocationBarController API, which allows the
      renderer compositor to calculate the position of the browser top header.
      This enables the header to be animated in sync with the content on
      scrolling
    - Fix LP: #1408136 - Committed LoadEvents fire for subframe loads when
      they shouldn't
    - Fix LP: #1377198 - CertificateError is not cancelled if you stop the
      pending navigation
    - Fix LP: #1373383 - The video player on Youtube does not resize correctly
      when transitioning from landscape to portrait. Ensure we correctly
      update the screen geometry and orientation visible to web content when
      the device orientation changes, and turn on orientation events
    - Really fix LP: #1337506 - Abort with
      "FATAL:texture_manager.cc(76)] Check failed: texture_count_ == 0u (1 vs. 0)"

    - Fix LP: #1398044 - Fails to build with Qt 5.4
    - Fix LP: #1249387 - Add experimental support for playing audio through
      mediahub with the HTML media elements (Off by default. Video and
      MediaSource are not yet implemented. Not built yet because it depends
      on packages in universe)
    - Fix LP: #1417042 - Remove inactive touch points from the current touch
      state when we process a new touch event
    - Fix LP: #1417963 - Adapt to behaviour change in handling of QVariants
      from QML to C++ in Qt 5.4
    - Update the form factor detection code to not rely on the EGL vendor for
      detecting that we're on a device - use the Android system properties
      instead
    - Tidy up WebContents ownership during unload by adding a new singleton
      responsible for handling unloading (WebContentsUnloader)
    - Refactor WebFrame to be based around RenderFrameHost rather than
      FrameTreeNode, which we aren't meant to be using
    - Call QDesktopServices::openUrl on the UI thread. Failures are no longer
      propagated back to the resource dispatcher, so all attempts to open a
      URL externally will result in the load being cancelled whether there
      is an external handler or not
  * Update debian/control to add extra build dependencies:
    - libandroid-properties-dev on armhf, used for gathering data for GPU
      feature blacklisting when running on the phone
  * Update debian/liboxideqtcore0.install to install V8 snapshot data
  * Drop oxideqmlscene - this was only necessary when qmlscene didn't support
    setting up a shared GL context

      Ensure that we keep the browser compositor GL context and associated
      resources alive as long as the Qt scenegraph holds the frontbuffer
    - Fix LP: #1377755 - Keyboard disappears when switching between text fields
    - Fix LP: #1290821 - WebView.loading is not false when receiving a LoadEvent
      with type == TypeStopped, so properties bound to this never receive an
      update. As "loading" and the main-frame document load events are delivered
      separately from blink, split this in to 2 signals
    - Fix LP: #1354382 - White line at bottom of viewport - fix rounding errors

  * Update to v1.2.0
    - Bump Chromium rev to 38.0.2125.24
    - Add WebContext.devtoolsBindIp property
    - Refactor the various BrowserContext classes to avoid having to modify
      2 implementations of BrowserContext each time we add functionality that's
      shared between the normal and OTR contexts
    - Assert that BrowserContext is only accessed on the main thread
    - Fix LP: #1224707 - Use a localized Accept-Language header
    - Fix various threading issues in the interaction of WebContext and
      WebContextDelegateWorker
    - Don't leak the default WebPreferences object when setting a custom one
    - Make certificate revocation checking work properly, which is also
      required for EV to work. Also fixes some console spew (LP: #1240723)
    - Fix LP: #1361868 - Don't leak GeolocationPermissionRequest if there are
      no handlers on WebView.geolocationPermissionRequested
    - Fix LP: #1214034:
      + Add API's to query the security status of the webview
        (WebView.securityStatus property + SecurityStatus and SslCertificate
        classes)
      + Add WebView.certificateError signal and CertificateError class to
        give the application a chance to allow certain SSL errors (some errors
        are non-overridable and this is enforced by Oxide - in which case, the
        signal only acts as a notification)
      + Add WebView.blockedContent property, which is a bitmask of content
        types that have currently been blocked - currently this only indicates
        MixedDisplay and MixedScript, but will be extended later on for other
        content types (eg, cookies, popups etc)
      + Add WebView.setCanTemporarily{Display,Run}InsecureContent functions,
        which allows the mixed content blocker preferences to be overridden
        temporarily (will reset on navigation to a new page)
    - Fix LP: #1355703 - Linkedin profiles don't render correctly because
      it triggers the mixed content blocker. Change the default for
      WebPreferences.canDisplayInsecureContent to true to allow secure sites
      to display insecure content. We can do this now we have a security
      status API, as displaying insecure content results in
      SecurityStatus.securityLevel indicating a degraded level. This is the
      same default as Chrome. Note, insecure scripts are still blocked by
      default
    - Various fixes to the CookieManager API:
      - Ensure that requests don't always get the same request ID
      - Don't depend on undefined behaviour (signed integer overflow)
      - Chromium can run callbacks for cookie requests synchronously - take
        this in to account to avoid potentially hidden reentrancy issues
      - Ensure that the responses at the API level always happen asynchronously
      - Make it possible to set a session cookie instead of setting the expiry
        to the Unix epoch when an expiration date isn't specifed (which then
        gets rejected by Chromium for being already expired)
      - Ensure that session cookies returned from the API don't have an expiry
        date set to the Unix epoch (LP: #1362558)
      - Rename CookieManager.gotCookies to CookieManager.getCookiesResponse and
        CookieManager.cookiesSet to CookieManager.setCookiesResponse
      - CookieManager.getCookiesResponse no longer returns a status code.
        The only time getCookies can fail is before WebContext is fully
        initialized, which we can indicate synchronously by returning an
        invalid request ID
      - CookieManager.getCookies() has been added so that it's possible to
        request the cookies for a specific URL
      - The cookie expirationdate attribute now accepts QML's built-in Date
        type
      - URL parameters in the API are now QUrl rather than QString
      - When the response to setCookies indicates an error it's impossible
        to know which cookies failed to set. Get rid of the status parameter
        from CookieManager.setCookiesResponse and replace it with a list
        of failed cookies instead

      the selected API is thread-local. We do still need to temporarily select

      it relies on its own custom handler). We do still set the SIGPIPE action
      to SIG_IGN, but only if it is SIG_DFL when we start. We also abort if the
      SIGCHLD action is SIG_IGN when we initialize

    - Set no_javascript_access in ContentBrowserClient::CanCreateWindow()
      to fix random window opening failures (LP: #1307735)
    - Add fullscreen API to WebView (LP: #1308947)
    - Set a wait cursor when loading
    - Add geolocation support
    - Add a WebView.geolocationPermissionRequested API
    - Allow unhandled key events to bubble up from the WebView (LP: #1313727)
    - Don't generate keypress events with unmodified text for control
      characters. This makes Oxide behave more like Chrome
    - Add WebView.loadHtml() (LP: #1320848)
    - Ensure we update the visibility in a renderer when a WebView is created
      initially hidden and then made visible before any content is loaded
      (LP: #1322622)
    - Build fixes for Qt 5.3
    - Display controls in media player (LP: #1326852)
  * Refresh debian/patches/gross-hack-for-dual-ffmpeg-build.patch
  * Don't build with ENABLE_OXIDEQMLSCENE now, as that's the default
    - update debian/rules
  * Update build dependencies - we now depend on ninja

oxide-qt (1.0.0~bzr501-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Update to r501
    - Update to Chromium 35.0.1916.27
    - Use GpuDataManager for checking feature support before enabling
      compositing (although, there's no GPU blacklist support yet)
    - When resizing in non-compositing mode, handle the case where a site is
      slow to repaint and Chromium gives us a backing store for the old size
    - In compositing mode, make sure we composite during resizes
    - Fix a crash during resize caused by us sending more than one acknowledge
      for a buffer swap
  * Don't advertise support for codecs that aren't supported by the
    oxideqt-codecs* package installed
    - add debian/patches/gross-hack-for-dual-ffmpeg-build.patch

oxide-qt (1.0.0~bzr490-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Update to r490
    - Build with enable_plugins: 0 and toolkit_views: 0 to trim the size
      a bit
    - Ensure subframe navigations that require a new window become top-level
      navigations for webviews that don't implement WebView.newViewRequested
    - Add an option for enabling proprietary codecs (ENABLE_PROPRIETARY_CODECS)
    - Build and install the l10n pak files
    - Add file picker support (LP: #1260008)

      HTML)
    - Fix a crash that occurs when handling events from some mouse buttons
    - Add cursor support (LP: #1257662)
    - Reimplement Chromium's RenderSandboxHostLinux so that it runs the sandbox
      IPC helper process as a proper child process rather than just forking
      the browser process, which is dangerous for Oxide (LP: #1304648)
  * Split libffmpegsumo.so in to 2 separate packages (oxideqt-codecs and
    oxideqt-codecs-extra) (LP: #1301341)
